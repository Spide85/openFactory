# OpenFactory
![CI Build](https://api.travis-ci.com/Spide85/openFactory.svg?branch=master)
A clone of the beautiful game Factorio.

To build the project, python3 is required (In PATH, the script folder needs to be in PATH too).
Boost and SDL2 too as currently there is an issue with conans pkg_config file and meson. Look at the .travis.yml.
